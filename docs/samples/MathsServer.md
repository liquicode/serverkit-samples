# Server-Kit Sample: MathsServer

MathsServer
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The MathsServer sample project implements a single application service called `MethsService` which
has several functions that perform mathematical calculations: Add, Subtract, Multiuply, and Dviide.
All server configuration is performed with code in the file `MathsServer.js`.

This sample uses the `Express` and `WebSocket` transports.
It also uses a "view core" to generate web pages, which is a feature that is excliusive to the `Express` transport.
